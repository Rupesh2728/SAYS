    reviewdesc:"Stylish, slick and action-packed film; in one work itâ€™s a â€˜Blockbusterâ€™. Film has actions, thrills, bit of suspense and gripping storyline. SRK is back with a bang and has made his fans delighted, a long wait proven worthy. John Abraham looks solid in his negative role and DeepikaP looks stunning, and she has also done some actions in the film along with flourishing her beauty. All the fight sequences and chases are indeed marvelous",

    reviewdesc:"Enjoyed watching TJMM! RK as Mickey looked sooo handsome, naive and so presentable! A mamma's boyðŸ¥° and a great lover! I really appreciate the director for showcasing the real problem and at the same time the solution of fast-paced lifestyle and days, family life! As we actually forget to notice positive things what a family can bring in  The trio perspective what a family, a guy and also the girl must actually look into and find the solution rather than cribbing and destroying relationship!",

    reviewdesc:"Surprised to see the poor reviews by a good few to this movie. I had set my expectations low walking to this movie, and was pleasantly surprised and found it really good.Kabzaa is a mass masala movie showcasing rise of the underdog to the helm of underworld. This journey involves violence, double plays, shrewdness, and a devil may care attitude by the hero Arkeshwara, played superbly by Upendra.",
